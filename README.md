## Notes

I had an idea in my mind which required a few extra features such as use of icons, transferring data between two screens and splitting the bill. I have used Font Awesome for my website design before, and I found a tutorial on GitHub how to install and use Font Awesome for IOS app. Took a lot of time to install third party library into IOS application. Splitting the bill based on number of people, required just one more line of code, but transferring the date from one screen to another was very challenging and took me a lot of time. That was very easy to break the code, but challenging to find what is broken.
